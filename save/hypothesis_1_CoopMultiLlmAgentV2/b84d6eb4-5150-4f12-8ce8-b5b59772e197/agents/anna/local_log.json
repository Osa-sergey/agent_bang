Immediate Goals**  \n- **Identify Threats**: Pressure suspicious players (andy, john) to reveal intentions.  \n- **Protect the Sheriff**: Divert attacks away from serg.  \n- **Conserve Resources**: Save \"MISS!\" for critical moments (e.g., if Sheriff is targeted).  \n\n#### **3. Proposed Actions**  \n**A. Psychological Play (Chat Message)**  \n*\"Andy, you were quick to call out 'Bandits'\u2014sounds like you\u2019re organizing them.
