Follow-Up Plan**  \n- **If players lose HP**: Note who took damage (potential Bandits/Renegade).  \n- **If players discard BANG!**:  \n  - **Deputies** likely did so to avoid damage.  \n  - **Bandits** may have kept BANG! for future attacks.  \n- **Save MISS!** for inevitable retaliation.  \n\n#### **4.
